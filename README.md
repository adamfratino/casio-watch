#### When in Clock Mode

- Turn on Indiglo by clicking and holding `Light`

#### When in Stopwatch Mode

- Toggle start and stop using the `Start/Stop` button
- Reset the stopwatch using the `Light` button

### Setup

Install node modules using `npm install`

After installation completes, use `gulp` command to build and watch (get it?) the project.

**NOTE:** Browsersync will initiate a server and open the project automatically.
